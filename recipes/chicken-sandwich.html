    <h3>What's special about this buff chicken sandwich?</h3>

    <p>This crockpot Buffalo chicken is great for hearty sandwiches that will please those 
        who love Buffalo chicken wings. This recipe is perfect for those days spent watching football or Formula1.
         I like to top these with blue cheese or ranch dressing. </p><br>

    <p>These are famous for it's mouthfilling steak and the vibrant salad flavours with a banger combination of native peri-peri 
        french fries.</p>

    <h4>Steps To Follow</h4>

        <li>Place chicken breasts into the slow cooker; pour in 3/4 of the wing sauce and ranch dressing mix.</li>
