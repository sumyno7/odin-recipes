    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Deep-fried Oreos are a carnival favorite where I grew up.
         Oreos get dipped into pancake batter and fried — yummy! 
         You can do this with or without a deep fryer.</p>
    <p>They melt throughout the mouth whilst giving the sizzling hit 
        of oreo cream that really feels the heart!</p>
